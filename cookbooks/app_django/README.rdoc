For more info see: {Release Notes}[http://support.rightscale.com/18-Release_Notes/ServerTemplates_and_RightImages/current] (Section 'Django App Server' under ServerTemplates)

Please checkout the tutorial: {Django App Server}[http://support.rightscale.com/03-Tutorials/Django_App_Server_Beta]

ServerTemplate built on this cookbook can be combined in two modes:

1 - For apps with bundler support, keep the "requirements.txt" file under application ROOT directory, and
"run_custom_python_commands" for migration commands

2 - For apps without bundler support, provide package(s) name as user input while server launch, and
"run_custom_python_commands" for migration commands

Note: In operational mode to install additional python packages for Django app server, provide package(s) name as user input
and re-run the <tt>app::default</tt> boot recipe.

Mix these recipes in any way to satisfy project requirements.

=== Attributes:

These are settings used in recipes and templates. Default values are noted.

Note: Only "internal" cookbook attributes are described here. Descriptions of attributes which have inputs you can find in metadata.rb cookbook file.

====== General attributes

* <tt>node[:app_django][:module_dependencies]</tt> - Modules required for Apache.
* <tt>node[:app_django][:app][:debug_mode]</tt> - Django application debug mode.
* <tt>node[:app_django][:apache][:serve_local_files]</tt> - Used to enable/disable the serve of any existing local files.
* <tt>node[:app_django][:deploy_dir]</tt> - Path in the specified repository where application code will be pulled from.
* <tt>node[:app_django][:pip_bin]</tt> - Path to Python pip bin directory.
* <tt>node[:app_django][:python_bin]</tt> - Path to Python bin directory.
* <tt>node[:app_django][:project][:opt_pip_list]</tt> - A list of additional python packages, required for django application
* <tt>node[:app_django][:project][:custom_cmd]</tt> - A list of python commands required for django application initialization.

=== Templates:

* <tt>apache_mod_wsgi_vhost.erb</tt> - Configuration for apache vhost file used in the <tt>app::setup_vhost</tt> recipe
  and defined in <tt>:setup_vhost</tt> action of the <tt>app_django</tt> LWRP.
* <tt>wsgi.py.erb</tt> - Configuration for Apache-Django WSGI config file used in the <tt>app::setup_vhost</tt> recipe

* <tt>settings.py.erb</tt> - Rename django "settings.py" file under app root to "settings_default.py", configure new "settings.py" file
  for project database connection used in the <tt>app::setup_db_connection</tt> recipe
  and defined in <tt>:setup_db_connection</tt> action of the <tt>app_django</tt> LWRP.

=== LWRPs:

<tt>app_django</tt> Lightweight provider is defined in the providers/default.rb file, it contains source for the following actions:

* <tt>:install</tt>
* <tt>:setup_vhost</tt>
* <tt>:start</tt>
* <tt>:stop</tt>
* <tt>:restart</tt>
* <tt>:reload</tt>
* <tt>:code_update</tt>
* <tt>:setup_db_connection</tt>

For more info about these actions, please see the <tt>app</tt> cookbook README.

For normal operations it requires "app" resource which will act as the interface to all <tt>app_django</tt> provider logic.
