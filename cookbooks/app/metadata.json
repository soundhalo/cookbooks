  "long_description": "= RightScale App Cookbook\n\n== DESCRIPTION:\n\nRightScale's cookbook for application server management.\n\nThis is an abstract cookbook that defines the recipes and interface to\napplication provider cookbooks.  It is not a standalone cookbook and must be\nused in conjunction with an application provider cookbook (i.e.\n<tt>app_php</tt>, app_tomcat, app_passenger, app_django or a user created application\nprovider).\n\nMore detailed information can be found in the descriptions for each recipe in the cookbook. <tt>app::*</tt>.\n\n== REQUIREMENTS:\n\n* Requires a VM launched from a RightScale managed RightImage\n* Requires a corresponding app provider cookbook\n\n== COOKBOOKS DEPENDENCIES:\nPlease see <tt>metadata.rb</tt> file for the latest dependencies.\n\n* <tt>sys_firewall</tt>\n* <tt>rightscale</tt>\n* <tt>repo</tt>\n* <tt>app_php</tt>\n* <tt>app_passenger</tt>\n* <tt>app_tomcat</tt>\n* <tt>app_django</tt>\n\n== KNOWN LIMITATIONS:\n\nThere are no known limitations.\n\n== SETUP:\n\nIn order to use App resource, you must create corresponding providers in your\napp server cookbook. For examples, see <tt>app_passenger</tt>, <tt>app_php</tt>, <tt>app_django</tt> or\n<tt>app_tomcat</tt> cookbooks.\n\nYou must define app attributes which will be used in the initialized\n<tt>app[default]</tt> resource.\n\nRequired attributes:\n\n  node[:app][:provider] = \"app_passenger\"\n\nRecommended:\n\n  node[:app][:destination]\n  node[:app][:port]\n  node[:app][:root]\n  node[:app][:database_name]\n  node[:app][:database_user]\n  node[:app][:database_password]\n  node[:app][:database_server_fqdn]\n  node[:app][:db_adapter]\n  node[:app][:module_dependencies]\n  node[:app][:user]\n  node[:app][:group]\n\nMore detailed descriptions of these attribute variables is located in the resource\nfile's description.\n\n== USAGE:\n\n1. Add the <tt>app_*::default</tt> recipe prior to the <tt>app::default</tt>\n   recipe to define the provider.\n2. Add the default recipe to tag your server as an appserver. This is used by\n   servers (like databases) to identify their clients.\n3. Add desired <tt>app::do_*</tt> recipes to your application server\n   ServerTemplate.\n4. Develop corresponding providers in your application server's cookbook.\n5. Define required and recommended attributes in your application server's\n   cookbook attributes file.\n\n== DETAILS:\n\n=== General\n\nThis cookbook can only be used in conjunction with cookbooks that contain\nLightweight Providers which implement the 'app' interface. See the RightScale\n<tt>app_php</tt> cookbook for an example.\n\nNote: <tt>app[default]</tt> resource uses the \"persist true\" flag, which allows you to\nsave the created resource and its attributes in memory for future use.\n\nThis cookbook contains recipes that are required to connect your instance to RightScale's\n\"Load Balancer\" ServerTemplates:\n\n* <tt>do_loadbalancers_allow</tt>\n* <tt>do_loadbalancers_deny</tt>\n* <tt>request_loadbalancer_allow</tt>\n* <tt>request_loadbalancer_deny</tt>\n\nFor more info please see: {Load Balancer Setups}[http://support.rightscale.com/03-Tutorials/HAProxy_Load_Balancer_Server_Setup].\n\n=== Attributes:\n\n* <tt>node[:app][:provider]</tt> - Set a default provider.\n* <tt>node[:app][:port]</tt> - Set a default port to listen on. Default: 8000\n* <tt>node[:app][:ip]</tt> - IP to listen on. Default: First private IP\n* <tt>node[:app][:user]</tt> - Application server user. Required for changing owner of created project dirs.\n* <tt>node[:app][:group]</tt> - Application server group. Required for changing owner of created project dirs.\n\n=== Definitions:\n\n<b>app_add_listen_port</b>\nAdds a port to the apache listen 'ports.conf' file and node attribute.\n\nCreate <tt>node[:apache][:listen_ports]</tt> - array of strings for the web server to listen on.\n\nThis definition created specifically for the <tt>apache2</tt> cookbook at this time.\n\n===== Example:\n\n app_add_listen_port php_port\n\n=== Libraries-helpers:\n\n===== RightScale::App::Helper.vhosts(vhost_list)\n\nCreated to convert vhost names into an array from a comma-separated list.\n\n<b>Parameters</b>\n\n<tt>vhost_list(Sting)::</tt> Comma-separated list of virtual hosts.\n\n<b>Returns</b>\n\n<tt>Array::</tt> Array of vhosts\n\n=== LWRPs:\n\nThis cookbook provides the abstract <tt>app</tt> resource, which will act as\nan \"interface\" for corresponding Lightweight app_* providers.\n\nThis includes <tt>app_php</tt>, <tt>app_tomcat</tt>, <tt>app_passenger</tt> and <tt>app_django</tt>\ncookbooks. Each of them contains an implementation of the corresponding app__*\nLightweight Provider which can be called using this resource.\n\nTo avoid unexpected failures, the Provider persisted in this cookbook will act as a \ncap if there is no other app_ Light Weight Provider implementation. \n\nFor more information about Lightweight Resources and Providers (LWRPs), please\nsee: {Lightweight Resources and Providers (LWRP)}[http://support.rightscale.com/12-Guides/Chef_Cookbooks_Developer_Guide/08-Chef_Development/Lightweight_Resources_and_Providers_(LWRP)].\n\n===== App resource actions\n\nAll actions declared in this resource are intended to act as templates to typical\napplication server setup operations.\n\n* <tt>:install</tt> - Install packages required for application server setup.\n* <tt>:setup_vhost</tt> - Action designed to set up APP LWRP with common\n  parameters required for apache vhost file.\n* <tt>:start</tt> - Action designed to set up a user defined start sequence for\n  the application server.\n* <tt>:stop</tt> - Action designed to set up a user defined stop sequence for\n  the application server.\n* <tt>:restart</tt> - Action designed to set up a user defined restart sequence for\n  the application server.\n* <tt>:reload</tt> - Action designed to set up a user defined reload sequence for\n  the application server.\n* <tt>:code_update</tt> - Action designed to perform project source code\n  update/download.\n* <tt>:setup_db_connection</tt> - Action designed to perform database\n  configuration file creation.\n* <tt>:setup_monitoring</tt> - Action designed to set up and install required\n  monitoring software.\n\n===== App resource attributes\n\n* <tt>packages</tt> - Set of installed packages\n* <tt>root</tt> - Application root\n* <tt>port</tt> - Application port\n* <tt>destination</tt> - The path on the instance where the application code will be placed\n* <tt>database_name</tt> - Name of the required database\n* <tt>database_user</tt> - Database user\n* <tt>database_password</tt> - Database password\n* <tt>database_server_fqdn</tt> - Database server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN)\n* <tt>user</tt> - App user\n* <tt>group</tt> - Group the app user belongs to\n\n===== Usage Examples:\nBelow are a few basic examples. More detailed examples of this resource use can be\nfound in the <tt>do_*</tt> and <tt>setup_*</tt> recipes in the cookbook.\n\n app \"default\" do\n   persist true\n   provider node[:app][:provider]\n   packages node[:app][:packages]\n   action :install\n end\n\n app \"default\" do\n   database_name node[:app][:database_name]\n   database_user node[:app][:database_user]\n   database_password node[:app][:database_password]\n   database_server_fqdn node[:app][:database_server_fqdn]\n   action :setup_db_connection\n end\n\n app \"default\" do\n   root node[:app][:root]\n   port node[:app][:port].to_i\n   action :setup_vhost\n end\n\n== LICENSE:\n\nCopyright RightScale, Inc.
