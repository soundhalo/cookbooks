recipe "app::install_server",
  "Adds the appserver:active=true, appserver:listen_ip=<ip> and" +
  " appserver:listen_port=<port> tags to your server which identifies it" +
  " as an application server and tells the load balancer what IP address" +

  " will update its firewall port permissions to accept incoming requests" +
  " from application servers with this tag."

recipe "app::do_loadbalancers_deny",
  "Denies connections from all load balancers which are tagged with" +
